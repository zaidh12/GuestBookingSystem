# GuestBookingSystem

Guest booking program for a hotel group named PhumlaKamnandi. This project was done in a group format for INF2011F.

HOW IT WOULD WORK:

The receptionist or hotel staff access it on hotel computers, and while being on call with customers, they input the details for the customers' bookings.
This includes duration of stay and number of rooms. 

The idea is that the application checks for availability, prices depending on season and then confirms the booking and stores it in a database for viewing, updating and deleting.
